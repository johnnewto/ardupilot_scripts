# ardupilot_scripts
ardupilot scripts for sea drone

## Repository Structure

The repository contains a `scripts` directory that is symlinked to the ArduPilot repository. This allows the scripts to be used directly within the ArduPilot environment.

### Setting up the Symlink

To create the symlink between this repository and ArduPilot:

```bash
ln -s ~/repos/ardupilot_scripts/scripts ~/repos/ardupilot/scripts
```

This creates a symbolic link that makes the scripts in this repository available to ArduPilot while maintaining the ability to version control them separately.

### Available Scripts

The `scripts` directory contains:

- `position_report.lua`: A Lua script for reporting vehicle position data. This script is used within the ArduPilot environment to track and report the position of the sea drone.

## Running SITL Simulation

The repository includes a `run_sim.sh` script to launch ArduPilot's Software In The Loop (SITL) simulation for a motorboat vehicle.

### Prerequisites
- ArduPilot installed and configured
- Python environment with required dependencies
- SITL simulation files (including eeprom.bin)

### Running the Simulation

1. Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x run_sim.sh
```

2. Run the simulation:
```bash
./run_sim.sh
```

The script will:
- Kill any existing sim_vehicle processes
- Launch a new SITL simulation with the following configuration:
  - Vehicle type: Rover
  - Frame: motorboat
  - Location: Orakei Bay
  - Speedup: 1x
  - Serial2 interface: UART on /dev/ttyUSB1
  - Console and map interfaces enabled


3. Arm

To arm or disarm the vehicle in SITL using MAVProxy, use the following commands in the MAVProxy console:

- To arm:
  ```
  arm throttle
  ```
- To force arm (bypass checks):
  ```
  arm throttle force
  ```
- To disarm:
  ```
  disarm
  ```

For more details and advanced options (such as enabling/disabling specific arming checks), see the official ArduPilot documentation: [Arming and Disarming with MAVProxy](https://ardupilot.org/mavproxy/docs/uav_configuration/arming.html)

### Simulation Files

The SITL simulation uses several files in the simulation directory:
- `eeprom.bin`: Stores simulated vehicle parameters
- `motorboat.parm`: Vehicle-specific parameters
- Other configuration files as needed

### Alternative Configurations

The script includes commented-out alternative configurations for:
- Different serial interfaces
- CSV-based simulation
- Different USB device paths

To use an alternative configuration, uncomment the desired line and comment out the current active configuration.
